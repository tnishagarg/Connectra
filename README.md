# Connectra

## Project Overview

Connectra is a role-based full-stack web application designed to connect influencers with clients (brands, event organizers, or individuals) for digital collaborations, promotions, and event marketing.

The platform simplifies the process of discovering influencers and enables smooth collaboration between both parties through structured profiles and search features.

## User Roles

Connectra supports two types of users:

### Influencer
Influencers can showcase their expertise, social presence, and availability for collaborations.

### Client
Clients can search, discover, and connect with suitable influencers for promotions and partnerships.

## How Influencers and Clients Connect

1. A user signs up and selects a role (Influencer or Client).
2. Influencers create and update their profile with domains, city, and social media links.
3. Influencers post their availability or upcoming events.
4. Clients search for influencers by field, city, or name.
5. Clients view influencer profiles and reach out via social links or contact details.
6. Influencers and clients collaborate externally for promotions or events.
